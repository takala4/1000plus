特に最後のPlay the long gameが一番刺さった．

>While being at a big institution gives you access to an initial network, in the long term you want to develop a network of smart people that you can work with. One of the best ways to build a network is by being proactive and helping people as much as you can. This can be through writing blog posts or libraries, publishing tutorials and courses, doing podcasts, reimplementing models, or helping with open-source software. If you do this consistently, you will develop a reputation for being diligent and helpful and people will want to work with you.


日頃思っていることと一致する．
